add a button to folder all columns at once next to the filename. when pressed it folds all columns in the board, when pressed again it unfolds all columns. if all columns are folded the fold button should fold as well, if all columns are unfolded it should show unfolded, if mixed, keep the last state. make sure the folded state is kept even when the interface is completely redrawn.

---

The button in the column header to toggle the cards folding should be hidden when the column is folded.

---

Add a single + button at the bottom of the column label when folded to add a card, which then also unfolds the column. 

---

The kanban board should store the folded state in memory, do not modify the markdown to store the data, only during the edit session. currently when i switch to a different document and back the folding state is reset.

an column that has no cards should be folded by default on document load.

---

the folding state of the columns and the cards are sometimes retained, but sometimes lost during work with different files. also sometimes during editing i loose focus of the field i am editing. might this be related to webcanvas redraws? can you make sure they are allways immediately applied. the only moment i would expect a external redraw is when i am editing the markdown-data the table is based upon. explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

---

add a search function where i can enter a search term, similar to the vscode search. add a text field, 3 toggle buttons: "case sensitive", "only complete words", "regular expression search", an index of the currently found entry (1 of X), the number of found results, a arrow up (previous result) arrow down (next result). a button to close the search. by searching the screen should jump to the card with the found result. explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

---

add the functionality to add check for tags in different parts of the markdown. tags are #words_without_spaces . if a tags is in the column header, it influences the column coloring (but not the cards). if a tag is in the card header, it influences the card color. if a tag is within the description it only sets the color of the tag-word. the tag itself should allways be enclosed in a rounded border.

also add a configuration which allows adding tags with a corresponding color for text and background, as well as the same colors (text & background) for dark mode (in total 4 colors).

explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

-

please write the corresponding code. Always write out full functions and where they should be added to. dont change the way the markdown is saved, except for what the user enters manually. 

-

the functionality to modify the css appears to be missing. the cards and columns get the tags. but something that writes a css similar to """
.task-item[data-task-tag="bug"] {
  background-color: #440000;
  color: #900;
}
""" is missing.

when drag&dropping columns and rows it's currently displaying the drop location only. is it possible to move the whole object and interactively display the outcome in realtime? explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

---

add a burger menu in the file-info-bar. move the buttons undo, redo, lock and open file in there. leave the lock symbol (without the text) outside as well. the columns folding option and the title should stay outside. additionally add 2 items new burger menu: "column width" with an submenu with the options "small, medium, wide" as well as number of rows with the options 1, 2, 3, 4. the column width should modify an css variable named --column-width, which by with medium is 350px, small is 250px, wide is 450px. the rows are by default 1. if set to 2, 3, 4 it should add vertical rows that allow the columns to be ordered vertically. for columns that are moved to the second, 3th or 4th row, add a tag to the column header with #row2, #row3, #row4. when loading a file, detect the largest #rowNUMBER tag an set the number of rows to this value. explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

please write the corresponding code. Always write out full functions and where they should be added to. dont change the way the markdown is saved, except for adding the tags for the columns.

---

the dropping of files from the explorer is broken. it shows the message "Drop files here to create links" and blocks then, it doesnt display a location to drop in multi-row layout. It does work in the single row layout. explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

---

in multi row mode, show the "+ Add Column" on each row, add it to the respective row it's on (using the tags #row2, #row3, #row4). explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

---

when alt+clicking on a link in the kanban board it should open the file instead of starting to edit the text.  explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible.

---

it doesnt start editing now, but it also doesnt open the file. when it's a file extension known to vscode it should open in there, but if it's an unknown extension it should open in the externally (os) defined programm

---

when editing a markdown column title with the tag #row2, #row3, #row4 dont show these tags during editing. explain your planned changes first without editing the sourcecode. keep the changes as minimal as possible. dont change or add any addtional features. dont add failsaves or backup solutions. only describe your solution, dont implement it!!!

-

please write the corresponding code. Always write out full functions and where they should be added to.

---

Add all available tags to both buger menus (column & cards) as a submenu point "Tags". A submenu should show the name of the tag and a checkbox next to it wether the tag is currently active. Show the same function in the column and the cards burger menu. When editing the cards tags, only add them to the title. keep the changes as minimal as possible. dont change or add any addtional features. dont add failsaves or backup solutions. only describe your solution, dont implement it yet!!!

---

we will use the "Grouped Configuration Structure". also add border styles with the option to only have a left border or full borders around the card/column. add header & footer bars option as well as corner badges (without patterns). each tag should can have optionally have any of these styles. for the styling use the first occurrence from the tags in order of appearance on the column or card. summarize the change and give me an example configuration of one item. keep the changes as minimal as possible. reuse existing functions if possible. dont add failsaves or backup solutions. only describe your solution, dont implement it yet!!!

## Summary of Changes

### Configuration Structure Enhancement

Extend the grouped tag configuration in `package.json` to support additional optional styling properties for each tag:

-   **border**: Style borders (left-only or full)
-   **headerBar**: Top accent bar
-   **footerBar**: Bottom accent bar
-   **cornerBadge**: Corner badge with text

### Styling Priority

-   Use the **first tag** found in the title (order of appearance) for styling
-   The existing `extractFirstTag()` function already handles this
-   Columns and cards will get styled based on their first tag only

### CSS Generation Update

Enhance `generateTagStyles()` in `boardRenderer.js` to generate CSS for:

-   Border variants (left vs full)
-   Header/footer bars (absolutely positioned elements)
-   Corner badges (::before/::after pseudo-elements)

## Example Configuration

```
"markdown-kanban.tagColors": {
  "type": "object",
  "default": {
    "status": {
      "urgent": {
        "light": {
          "text": "#ffffff",
          "background": "#dc3545"
        },
        "dark": {
          "text": "#000000",
          "background": "#ff7b89"
        },
        "border": {
          "style": "dashed",      // solid, dashed, dotted, double
          "width": "3px",
          "position": "left",      // left, full
          "color": "#ff0000"       // optional, defaults to background color
        },
        "headerBar": {
          "height": "4px",
          "color": "#ff0000",      // optional, defaults to background color
          "style": "solid"         // solid, gradient
        },
        "footerBar": {
          "height": "3px",
          "color": "#ff0000",
          "text": "URGENT",         // optional text overlay
          "textColor": "#ffffff"
        },
        "cornerBadge": {
          "text": "!",
          "position": "top-right",  // top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
          "style": "circle",        // circle, square, ribbon
          "color": "#ff0000",       // background color
          "textColor": "#ffffff"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1\. **Enhanced CSS Generation**

Modify `generateTagStyles()` to check for additional properties and generate corresponding CSS:

```
// For each tag with additional styles:
// - Generate border CSS based on position (left vs full)
// - Add ::before pseudo-element for headerBar
// - Add ::after pseudo-element for footerBar  
// - Add positioned div for cornerBadge (using data attribute for text)
```

### 2\. **Menu Generation**

Update `generateTagMenuItems()` to handle grouped structure:

-   Iterate through groups (status, type, priority, etc.)
-   Create nested submenus for each group
-   Keep the same checkbox toggle functionality

### 3\. **Tag Application**

No changes needed - existing functions already:

-   Apply `data-column-tag` and `data-task-tag` attributes
-   Use `extractFirstTag()` to get the first tag for styling
-   Toggle tags via `toggleColumnTag()` and `toggleTaskTag()`

### 4\. **CSS Classes Generated**

```
/* Border - left only */
.kanban-column[data-column-tag="urgent"] {
  border-left: 3px dashed #ff0000 !important;
}

/* Border - full */
.task-item[data-task-tag="urgent"] {
  border: 3px dashed #ff0000 !important;
}

/* Header bar */
.kanban-column[data-column-tag="urgent"]::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 4px;
  background: #ff0000;
}

/* Footer bar with text */
.task-item[data-task-tag="urgent"]::after {
  content: 'URGENT';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 20px;
  background: #ff0000;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-size: 10px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

/* Corner badge */
.task-item[data-task-tag="urgent"] .corner-badge {
  position: absolute;
  top: -8px;
  right: -8px;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #ff0000;
  color: #ffffff;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

The implementation reuses existing tag detection and only extends the CSS generation to include these new style properties.

please write the corresponding code. Always write out full functions and where they should be added to. dont change the way the markdown is saved, except for adding the tags for the columns. explicitly mention functions that can be removed or simplified.

can you add a configuration option to limit the row size. a setting of 0 means that it's the full cards height, other values limit the height. keep the changes as minimal as possible. dont change or add any addtional features. dont add failsaves or backup solutions. dont change any styles apart from the maximum row height.
