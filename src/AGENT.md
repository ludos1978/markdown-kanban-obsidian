add a button to folder all columns at once next to the filename. when pressed it folds all columns in the board, when pressed again it unfolds all columns. if all columns are folded the fold button should fold as well, if all columns are unfolded it should show unfolded, if mixed, keep the last state. make sure the folded state is kept even when the interface is completely redrawn.

The button in the column header to toggle the cards folding should be hidden when the column is folded.

---

Add a single + button at the bottom of the column label when folded to add a card, which then also unfolds the column. 

---

The kanban board should store the folded state in memory, do not modify the markdown to store the data, only during the edit session. currently when i switch to a different document and back the folding state is reset.

an column that has no cards should be folded by default on document load.
