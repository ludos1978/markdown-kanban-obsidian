## Open Bugs

- [ ] if there is an image in the clipboard, and the user drags it into the kanban board. can you create the image within an subfolder named "basefilename-MEDIA" and include in the board with this new file?
- [ ] if there are multiple filenames/paths in the clipboard, can you make links out of all them automatically, there is already a conversion based on filetype happening, but only for single file-path-names. assume newlines to be eigher \r, \r\n or \n (all types). consider windows, linux and osx paths as paths to convert to link style (also consider c:\... paths, make sure to escape filepaths in %escape / url escaping if they have invalid characters in them such as brackets, curly, etc...)
  it's not required to resolve the paths. also in here it tries to make a absolute path by adding the local path to an already absolute path. can you verify on what os we are on and depending on that do different path handling.
- [ ] when opening a new kanban the clipboard is correctly initialized, but shortly after it gets overwritten by "Testing clipboard ..."
- [ ] saving during editing a markdown content does not work correctly. it should already be implemented, but doesnt seem to work. if it's too complicated to do while staying in edit mode, it's acceptable to end editing and then save. make sure you handle the end-edit functions.


## File Watcher Consolidation âœ…

### Create ExternalFileWatcher System

- [x] Create `src/externalFileWatcher.ts` with centralized file monitoring
- [x] Design event system for file changes (`main-file-changed`, `include-file-changed`, `include-file-deleted`)
- [x] Implement file registration/unregistration methods
- [x] Add loop prevention logic (`_isUpdatingFromPanel` check)
- [x] Support `fileListenerEnabled` flag integration

### Remove Duplicate Systems

- [x] Remove `setupMainFileWatcher()` function from `extension.ts:214-240`
- [x] Remove `documentSaveListener` from `extension.ts:243-256`
- [x] Remove `externalFileWatchers` Map from `extension.ts:212`
- [x] Remove cleanup code from `extension.ts:322-323`
- [x] Remove 3 calls to `setupMainFileWatcher()` (lines 81, 169, 201)

### Update KanbanWebviewPanel

- [x] Remove `_includeFileWatchers` array and related methods
- [x] Remove `_setupIncludeFileWatchers()` method (`lines 1272-1304`)
- [x] Remove `_cleanupIncludeFileWatchers()` method (`lines 1306-1311`)
- [x] Keep `_sendIncludeFileChangeNotification()` and `refreshIncludes()` methods
- [x] Add registration with ExternalFileWatcher on panel creation
- [x] Add unregistration on panel disposal
- [x] Update `loadMarkdownFile()` to re-register files when switching

### Preserve Critical Functionality

- [x] Maintain include file state management (`_includeFileContents`, `_changedIncludeFiles`, `_includeFilesChanged`)
- [x] Preserve `refreshIncludes()` message handler functionality
- [x] Keep loop prevention via `_isUpdatingFromPanel` checks
- [x] Maintain `fileListenerEnabled` toggle behavior

### Update Tests

- [ ] Remove `onDidSaveTextDocument` mock from `src/test/setup.js:14`
- [ ] Add ExternalFileWatcher mocks for testing
- [ ] Verify all file change scenarios still work

### Benefits

- Single source of truth for external file changes
- Eliminate ~200 lines of duplicate watcher code
- Better resource management (one watcher per file)
- Simplified debugging and error handling
- No functionality loss
